Reverting a single file to previous version

We've made some number of commits, five of which changed a given file, and we want to revert the file to one of the previous versions. First of all, git doesn't keep version numbers for individual files. It just tracks content - a commit is essentially a snapshot of the work tree, along with some meta-data (e.g. commit message). So, we have to know which commit has the version of the file we want. Once we know that, we'll need to make a new commit reverting the file to that state.

<ol>
	<li>
		Find right commit
		[bash]git log (-p) path/to/file[/bash]
	</li>
	<li>
		Or with command
		[bash]gitk path/to/file[/bash]
	</li>
	<li>
		Either way you will able to find SHA1 (hash) of the commit with you want for:
		[bash]
			# get the version of the file from the given commit
			git checkout <commit hash> path/to/file
			# commit the modification
			git commit
		[/bash]
	</li>
</ol>
