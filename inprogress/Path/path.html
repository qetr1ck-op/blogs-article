Useful commands:

Run dialog
Win+R
On Linux and Mac OS X, it usually holds all bin and sbin directories relevant for the current user. On Windows, it contains at least the C:\Windows and C:\Windows\system32 directories — that's why you can run calc.exe or notepad.exe from the command line or Run dialog, but not firefox.exe. (Firefox is located in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox)

Environment Variables in Windows are denoted with percent signs (%) surrounding the name:

%name%
echo

To display an environment variable's value in cmd.exe, type echo %name%.

C:\>echo %USERPROFILE%
C:\Users\Daniel
set

To create/set a variable, use set varname=value:

C:\>set FunnyCatPictures=C:\Users\Daniel\Pictures\Funny Cat Pictures

C:\>set FunnyCatPicturesTwo=%USERPROFILE%\Pictures\Funny Cat Pictures 2
To append/add a variable, use set varname=value;%varname%:

C:\>set Penguins=C:\Linux

C:\>set Penguins=C:\Windows;%Penguins%

C:\>echo %Penguins%

Environment variables set in this way are available for (the rest of) the duration of the Command Prompt process in which they are set, and are available to processes that are started after the variables were set.
