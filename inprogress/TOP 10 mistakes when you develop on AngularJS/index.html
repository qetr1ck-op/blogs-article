    1. MVC directory structure
</div>

When you work with MVC / MVW frameworks it's convenience to structure code by <code>MVC components</code> using the following template:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/qetr1ck-op/24404d318344f4b77595.js"></script>

But when project will rise it's hard to use such structure of folders. You always need to open a few folder at the same time. It isn't depend what IDE or tool you use (Sublime, VS, Vim with NerdTree) - it's uncomfortable.

To avoid this this developers often use grouping be <code>functionality type</code>:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/qetr1ck-op/9a0e5e9af7eed2f6aef3.js"></script>

The structure allows more faster search for files which are related to the same feature. It may puzzled at the beginning to share js with html or even with test files. But it saves a lot of time, because it's more natural.

     2. Modules (or lack of them)
</div>

At the beginning of development all functionalities include in a single module. But manage a such type of code is inconvenient:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/qetr1ck-op/f91462f76a1ca37f3232.js"></script>

The next most common approach is grouping objects by type:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/qetr1ck-op/3912656b35c16c50bce3.js"></script>

For better scalability and future re-usability - split code by feature:

    3. Dependency Injection
</div>

Pattern DI in AngularJS uses out of box. DI helps to keep code clean and helps with testing process.

Now AngularJS can't resolve minificated variables. Easiest solution is:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/qetr1ck-op/01721016841fc0760acd.js"></script>

Another way to handle DI with minification is <a href="https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate">ng-annotate</a> module. More information on official <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_05#a-note-on-minification">AngularJS docs</a>

    3.1. Global Dependencies
</div>

Often when writing AngularJS apps there will be a dependency on an object that binds itself to the global scope. This means it's available in any AngularJS code, but this breaks the dependency injection model.

AngularJS makes it simple to encapsulate these globals into modules so they can be injected like standard AngularJS modules.

    4. Fat controllers
</div>

It's easy, especially when starting out, to put to much logic in the controller. Controller should <b>never</b> do DOM manipulation. That's work for directives! Likewise business logic should live in services.

App data should be also stored and fetched in services, except when we need bound to the <code>$scope</code>. Services are singletons that persist throughout the lifetime of the application, while controllers are transient between application states. If data is stored in the controller then it will need to be fetched from somewhere when it is instantiate.

AngularJS works best when following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). If the controller is a coordinator between the view and the model, then the amount of logic it has should be minimal. This will also make testing much simpler.

    5. Service vs Factory vs Provider
</div>

What is service:

<ol>
    <li>It provides methods to keep, share and organize data across the lifetime of the Angular app</li>
    <li>Lazy loads, Angular only creates instance of a service when an application component depends on it</li>
    <li>Singleton object, application component dependent on the service work with the single instance</li>
</ol>

An Angular service can be created in five different ways:

<ol>
    <li>service</li>
    <li>factory</li>
    <li>provider</li>
    <li>value</li>
    <li>constant</li>
</ol>

The most verbose, but also the most comprehensive one is a <code>Provider</code> recipe. The remaining four recipe types — Value, Factory, Service and Constant — are just syntactic sugar on top of a provider recipe.

Here is a great examples by Misko:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/qetr1ck-op/dc7fb71d2d3f61b4de76.js"></script>

In this case the injectors simply return the value. But what if you want to compute the value?

<script src="https://gist.github.com/qetr1ck-op/1a02d77c585f4ed31397.js"></script>

So <code>factory</code> is a function which responsible to creating or/and modifying the value. Notice that the the factory function can ask for other <code>dependencies</code>

If you want to be more OO and have a class?

<script src="https://gist.github.com/qetr1ck-op/8ef78320b0af84631e00.js"></script>

But if we want to configure function <code>before injection</code>?

<script src="https://gist.github.com/qetr1ck-op/e98dbc733fb7be97877b.js"></script>

As a side <code>note</code>, <code>service</code>, <code>factory</code>, and value are all derived from provider:
