To transfer your Sublime Text configuration to fellow user you only need to copy

Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings for settings
Packages/User/Package Control.sublime-settings for list of plugins
Other configuration files (shortcut keys, SFTP server configs, etc.) could be transferred, but they are not critical or may contain sensitive information
It is not safe to copy plugins as is between environments, as plugins may contain operating system or computer specific dependencies. It’s better to copy Package Control.sublime-settings file only. On the next Sublime Text start up Package Control will automatically read the list of packages from this file and install any missing packages from Github.

Manually installed packages, those not through Package Control, must be installed by hand on the target computer.
